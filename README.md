# Overview:

This is a visually engaging and  advanced Battleship Game built using Python and Pygame, designed to simulate the classic naval war strategy game ‚Äî with a modern twist. The game features a level-based grid system (Easy, Hard), interactive UI, and an AI opponent.

It showcases turn-based gameplay, grid-based logic, and real-time feedback using hits, misses, and dynamic rendering. This project also demonstrates strong structuring in code, file organization, and scalable game logic.

# Key Features:

<br> ![1.](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.-Three_Difficulty_Levels-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Choose between Easy or Hard, each scaling the challenge and grid dimensions.

<br> ![2.](https://img.shields.io/badge/2.-Drag_and_Drop_Ship_Placement-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Player ships are represented with real ship images and can be placed intuitively on the grid by dragging and dropping.

<br> ![3.](https://img.shields.io/badge/3.-AI_Ship_Deployment-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> The AI randomly positions its ships on its side of the board with balanced distribution logic.

<br> ![4.](https://img.shields.io/badge/4.-Turn_Based_Combat-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Players take alternating turns firing at the opponent‚Äôs grid, with visual feedback for hits and misses.

<br> ![5.](https://img.shields.io/badge/5.-Dynamic_Gun_Turrets-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Each ship's gun visually rotates in real-time to follow the player's mouse cursor, enhancing immersion.

<br> ![6.](https://img.shields.io/badge/6.-Advanced_Sound_System-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Every action is accompanied by realistic sound effects‚Äîexplosions for hits, splashes for misses, and gunfire on attacks.

<br> ![7.](https://img.shields.io/badge/7.-Radar_Scanning_System-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> A tactical radar can be activated to sweep and reveal glimpses of hidden enemy ships on the board.

<br> ![8.](https://img.shields.io/badge/8.-Victory_Detection-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> The game automatically detects when all ships of a player are sunk, declaring the winner.

<br> ![9.](https://img.shields.io/badge/9.-Smooth_UI_and_Visual_Feedback-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Includes grid labels, animations, and action prompts for a polished user experience.


# Concepts Used:
<br> Programming Language: Python 3.X
<br> Libraries: Pygame ( for graphics, events, rendering )

Core Concepts:
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Event-driven programming
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Grid generation using NumPy
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Collision handling (mouse clicks & grid mapping)
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Turn-based state machine logic
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† AI logic with random attack generation
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Dynamic GUI rendering using Pygame

# How to use:

üîß Setup:

<br> 1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
<br> 2. Install Pygame if not already:
```python
pip install pygame
```

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Game:

<br> 1. Copy the source code from the file : src.c
<br> 2. Paste the code on a Python file & save it as ' **Battleship.py** '.

üéÆ Controls:

<br> 1. Placing Ships: 
- Place the ships on Left board: or click on ' **Randomize** '.
- Click on ' **Deploy** '.

<br> 2. Game Play:
- Click on grid boxes on Right board to fire shots on Opponent's ships.
- Use ' **Radar** ' to scan enemy waters and locate the ship.
