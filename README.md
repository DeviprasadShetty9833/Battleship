# Overview:

This is a visually engaging Battleship Game built using Python and Pygame, designed to simulate the classic naval war strategy game — with a modern twist. The game features a level-based grid system (Easy, Hard), interactive UI, and an AI opponent.

It showcases turn-based gameplay, grid-based logic, and real-time feedback using hits, misses, and dynamic rendering. This project also demonstrates strong structuring in code, file organization, and scalable game logic.

# Key Features:

1. **Three Difficulty Levels** – Choose between Easy or Hard, each scaling the challenge and grid dimensions.

2. **Drag-and-Drop Ship Placement** – Player ships are represented with real ship images and can be placed intuitively on the grid by dragging and dropping.

3. **AI Ship Deployment** – The AI randomly positions its ships on its side of the board with balanced distribution logic.

4. **Dynamic Gun Turrets** – Each ship's gun visually rotates in real-time to follow the player's mouse cursor, enhancing immersion.

5. **Radar Scanning System** – A tactical radar can be activated to sweep and reveal glimpses of hidden enemy ships on the board.

6. **Turn-Based Combat** – Players take alternating turns firing at the opponent’s grid, with visual feedback for hits and misses.

7. **Victory Detection** – The game automatically detects when all ships of a player are sunk, declaring the winner.

8. **Smooth UI and Visual Feedback** – Includes grid labels, animations, and action prompts for a polished user experience.
