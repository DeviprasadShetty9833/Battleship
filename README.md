# Overview:

This is a visually engaging and  advanced Battleship Game built using Python and Pygame, designed to simulate the classic naval war strategy game ‚Äî with a modern twist. The game features a level-based grid system (Easy, Hard), interactive UI, and an AI opponent.

It showcases turn-based gameplay, grid-based logic, and real-time feedback using hits, misses, and dynamic rendering. This project also demonstrates strong structuring in code, file organization, and scalable game logic.
