# Overview:

This is a visually engaging Battleship Game built using Python and Pygame, designed to simulate the classic naval war strategy game — with a modern twist. The game features a level-based grid system (Easy, Hard), interactive UI, and an AI opponent.

It showcases turn-based gameplay, grid-based logic, and real-time feedback using hits, misses, and dynamic rendering. This project also demonstrates strong structuring in code, file organization, and scalable game logic.

# Key Features:

Ship Placement:

- Player places 7 ships(Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Destroyer, Submarine, Patrol Boat, Rescue Boat) on the left grid.

- AI randomly places 7 ships on the right grid.

Turn-Based Combat:

- Player and AI take turns attacking each other’s grid.

- Hits and misses are visually indicated.

Win/Loss Logic:

- First to destroy all 8 of the opponent’s ships wins.

- Game-over message is shown upon win/loss.

Simple & Clean UI:

- Pygame-rendered grid

- Difficulty selection menu
